# QA Engineer – Product Quality Challenge (2–3 Hours)

## Note
This is a thinking exercise, not a delivery task.
We expect rough notes, sketches, and partial solutions — not polished documentation.

⸻

## Context

You are joining a team responsible for a live parcel-shipping flow used by real customers to purchase shipping labels.

System under test:
- Parcel Configuration
  https://www.gls-pakete.de/en/private-customers/parcel-shipping/parcel-configuration
- Cart & Checkout
  (reachable from the configuration flow)

This is production software.
Do not complete real payments.

⸻

## 🎯 Your Goal

Your goal is to build confidence in the quality of this product.

Assume:
- The team wants to ship improvements regularly
- Bugs here directly affect revenue and customer trust
- You have limited time and incomplete knowledge

There is no single correct approach.

⸻

## ⏱ Constraints
- Timebox: 2–3 hours total
- You are the only QA engineer
- No access to backend code or internal documentation
- You may use any tools, including AI assistants

⸻

## 📦 What to Submit

Submit whatever artifacts best represent your approach.

Examples (not requirements):
- Notes or bullet points
- Risk lists
- Test ideas or charters
- Minimal test cases
- Diagrams
- Automation experiments
- Exploratory findings

Quality of thinking > quantity of artifacts.

## 🧠 Required Reflections (important)

Please include short written answers to the following:

1. Understanding the Product
   - What does this product seem to care about more than other things?
   - Who are the primary users?
   - What assumptions did you have to make?

2. Quality Risks
   - What could realistically go wrong for customers or the business?
   - Which risks worried you the most, and why?

3. Decisions & Trade-offs
   - What did you choose to focus on?
   - What did you intentionally not do?
   - What would be your next step if you had one more day?

4. Use of Tools / AI (if applicable)
   - How did you use AI tools?
   - What outputs did you accept, modify, or reject?
   - Did anything generated by AI seem misleading or incorrect?
