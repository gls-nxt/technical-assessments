# Senior Backend Engineer Technical Assessment: Microservices, Database Design, & REST API Design

## Overview

This assessment is designed to evaluate your expertise as a Senior Backend Engineer, with a focus on microservices architecture, robust database design, and REST API development. You are expected to demonstrate your ability to design scalable, maintainable, and secure systems while explaining your design decisions.

---

## Scenario

Imagine you are leading the development of a new backend system for a rapidly growing SaaS application. The system is built on a microservices architecture, must handle a high volume of transactions, and provides a set of REST APIs for both internal and external consumption. Additionally, the solution must ensure data integrity and optimal performance across various database operations.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Microservices Architecture Proposal

- **Objective**: Design a high-level microservices architecture for the backend system.
- **Requirements**:
    - **Service Decomposition**:
        - Identify key services in your design and describe their responsibilities.
        - Explain how services communicate (e.g., synchronous REST calls, asynchronous messaging).
    - **Service Discovery & Communication**:
        - Discuss how services will discover and interact with each other.
    - **High-Level Diagram**:
        - Provide a clear diagram illustrating the microservices architecture.

### 2. Database Design and Data Management

- **Objective**: Develop a robust database design for one or more services in your architecture.
- **Requirements**:
    - **Database Choice**:
        - Justify your choice of database(s).
    - **Schema Design**:
        - Describe the schema design for a core service.
    - **Scalability & Data Partitioning**:
        - Explain how you would handle scalability challenges.

### 3. REST API Design

- **Objective**: Design a set of RESTful APIs for one of the core microservices.
- **Requirements**:
    - **Endpoint Design**:
        - Define a set of endpoints for CRUD operations on a key resource.
    - **Versioning & Documentation**:
        - Describe your approach to versioning the API to ensure backward compatibility.
    - **Security & Rate Limiting**:
        - Discuss strategies for securing the API.

### 4. Additional Considerations

- **Scalability & Fault Tolerance**:
    - Explain how your overall design (both microservices and database) addresses scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Testing & Monitoring**:
    - Briefly outline your approach to testing and monitoring the backend services, including unit tests, integration tests, and observability (logging, metrics, alerts).

---

## Deliverables

1. **Architecture Diagram**:
    - A visual representation of your proposed microservices architecture. This can be a diagram image or an embedded diagram within the document.

2. **Written Proposal**:
    - A detailed document (Markdown, PDF, etc.) explaining your design choices for the microservices architecture, database design, and REST API. Include:
        - An overview of the architecture and the rationale behind key decisions.
        - Descriptions of your microservices, database schema, and API endpoints.
        - Considerations for scalability, security, and fault tolerance.

3. **Optional Code Snippets or Pseudo-code**:
    - Provide sample code or pseudo-code that illustrates your approach to implementing one or more aspects of your design (e.g., API endpoints, database migrations, service-to-service communication).

---

## Submission Guidelines

- **Format**:
    - Submit your diagram (as an image or embedded in the document) along with your written proposal.
    - Include any code snippets or pseudo-code as separate files or embedded within the document.

- **Deadline**:
    - By [date].

- **Submission Method**:
    - Please send your completed assessment to: [glsnxt-engineering-leads@teams.gls-global.com](mailto:glsnxt-engineering-leads@teams.gls-global.com).

## Final Notes

There is no single “correct” answer—this assessment is intended to understand your approach to designing complex backend systems. We value clarity, justification of design choices, and adherence to best practices. Focus on detailing your thought process and explaining trade-offs in your design.

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your solution!
