# Software Technical-Lead / Software-Architect Assessment: Cloud Native Systems Design

## Overview

This assessment is designed to evaluate your expertise in designing robust, scalable, and resilient software systems using cloud native solutions. We expect you to demonstrate deep knowledge of software architecture best practices, modern cloud services, and how to lead technical initiatives that balance innovation with stability.

---

## Scenario

Imagine you are leading the architecture and design of a new cloud-native system for a global enterprise. The solution will support a suite of applications that need to be highly available, secure, and scalable. The system should leverage modern cloud services (e.g., containers, serverless, managed databases, etc.) and follow industry best practices in microservices architecture, DevOps, and continuous delivery.

## Tasks

### 1. Architecture Design Proposal

- **Objective**: Design a high-level architecture for a cloud-native system that supports a suite of enterprise applications.
- **Requirements**:
    - **Cloud-Native Principles**:
        - Explain how your design leverages cloud-native features.
        - Highlight how these choices support scalability, rapid deployment, and resilience.
    - **Service Decomposition**:
        - Describe the major components and services in your system.
        - Explain the communication patterns between these components.
    - **Infrastructure and Platform**:
        - Detail the cloud services and architectural patterns you will use.
        - Include considerations for infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD pipelines, and automated testing.

### 2. Best Practices and Design Considerations

- **Objective**: Illustrate your understanding of software system design best practices.
- **Requirements**:
    - **Scalability & Resilience**:
        - Discuss strategies for horizontal and vertical scaling, load balancing, and failover mechanisms.
        - Explain how your design ensures high availability and disaster recovery.
    - **Security**:
        - Outline security measures at both the infrastructure and application levels.
        - Describe how you would incorporate security best practices into your design lifecycle.
    - **Observability and Monitoring**:
        - Define your approach to monitoring, logging, and tracing across the system.
        - Consider tools and practices for proactive alerting and performance management.
    - **Cost Efficiency & Optimization**:
        - Explain how your design addresses cost management.

### 3. Technical Leadership and Decision Making

- **Objective**: Evaluate your ability to lead technical teams and drive architectural decisions.
- **Requirements**:
    - **Trade-off Analysis**:
        - Present at least one significant trade-off decision you would face during this project. Explain the factors you considered and justify your decision.
    - **Documentation & Communication**:
        - Discuss how you would document the architecture and communicate your vision to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
    - **Roadmap and Evolution**:
        - Describe your approach for evolving the system over time, including handling technical debt, incorporating feedback, and adopting emerging technologies.

## Deliverables

1. **Architecture Diagram**:
    - A visual representation of your proposed cloud-native architecture. This diagram should include major components, service interactions, and infrastructure details.

2. **Written Proposal**:
    - A comprehensive document (Markdown, PDF, etc.) that includes:
        - An overview of the architecture and rationale behind key design decisions.
        - Detailed descriptions of system components, best practices, and security measures.
        - Discussion of trade-offs, scalability, and long-term evolution strategies.

3. **Optional Code/POC**:
    - Any code snippets, IaC templates, or pseudo-code that support your proposal.

---

## Submission Guidelines

- **Format**:
    - Submit the architecture diagram (as an image or embedded in the document) along with your detailed written proposal.
    - Include any code snippets or additional artifacts as separate files or embedded within the document.

- **Deadline**:
    - By [date].

- **Submission Method**:
    - Please send your completed assessment to: [glsnxt-engineering-leads@teams.gls-global.com](mailto:glsnxt-engineering-leads@teams.gls-global.com).

## Final Notes

There is no single “correct” answer—this assessment is designed to understand your approach to complex software architecture challenges. We are looking for clarity, thoughtful trade-off analysis, and adherence to cloud native best practices. Focus on explaining your design decisions, addressing both technical and strategic considerations.

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your solution!
